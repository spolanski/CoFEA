# What is CoFEA?

> CoFEA is an initiative that aims to bring open-source simulation software closer to the industry problems. Even though CoFEA itself sounds like the magic drink which drives engineering minds, it is a combination of the words *cooperation* and *Finite Element Analysis*. That links with the goals of this project which are:
> * raise awareness of available open-source simulation software
> * increase confidence in using this software by testing it with benchmarks and real-life problems
> * develop Python tools and scripts to make usage easier and simpler
> * gather information on how to set up the simulation environment correctly

# How to contribute?

There are plenty of ways on how you could contribute:

* if you know how to use simulation software then you can help to make models
* if you posses programming skills then you can help to develop [CoFEA Meshpresso converter](https://github.com/spolanski/CoFEA/tree/master/meshpresso)
* if you are good at writing then you can help writing the docs
* finally, if you don't think you have anything from the above, but you are eager to learn just let us know!

:::{important}
If you posses some old FEA models which are validated experimentally and you could share them - do let us know! We will give them another life by checking them once again in the open-source software.
