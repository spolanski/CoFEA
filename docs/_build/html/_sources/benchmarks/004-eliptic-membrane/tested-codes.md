### How to apply pressure boundary condition

Please open your mesh with CalculiX GraphiX in read mode using:

```
cgx -c mesh_file.inp
```
Then in CGX window please click right button of mouse and choose Toggle command line. In command line please write:

```
comp NODESET do
send NODESET abq press value_of_press
```
In the same directory should appear file called NODESET.dlo which need to be included in *DLOAD section to apply pressure to boundary.
Positive value of pressure goes is compressing the element face.
